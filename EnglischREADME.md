The Rogel MK120,

is a dump truck I built for transporting all kinds of bulk materials.

There is really not much to say about it.

Configurations include a small color choice and a color choice of the rims.

The price is 95000â‚¬

As with my other mods, support for the tipper is on my DC https://discord.gg/9ykq9dHFEn

Thanks
